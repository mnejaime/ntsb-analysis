# ntsb-analysis

As a Private Pilot, I find these NTSB reports very compelling. Some entries in this dataset are not just abstract records, but accounts of accidents involving pilots I've trained with and known. My goal in analyzing this data is twofold: to apply my data science skills and satisfy my personal curiosity, and more importantly, to extract meaningful safety insights that can enhance my own training and potentially prevent future incidents within the flying community.
